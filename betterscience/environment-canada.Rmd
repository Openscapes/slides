My PhD research studying Humboldt squid in the Pacific Ocean was the start of my data and coding journey, where I learned how important coding and reproducibility was. and it's been over eight years since I finished my PhD and have been at NCEAS. So what I want to talk about today:

---
class: inverse
## The problem
### We often approach data analysis as an individual burden.
### This is slow, brittle, demoralizing, & perpetuates inequities.

<br>

## A contributing solution
### Reframe data analysis as a collaborative, open practice.
### Build for efficiency, resilience, empowerment, &  inclusion.

So I like to talk about this with star wars analogies.

We've all felt like Luke Skywalker here with data analysis, when we can't solve the the challenge in front of us with the skillsets we have.

It is demoralizing and lonely. And if you imagine Luke attempting to use whatever pulleys and ropes he might have with him, you know it wouldn't be pretty, it wouldn't be reproducible or reusable, and it probably wouldn't get him where he needs to be on time.

transition: but luckily what happens next is that he meets Yoda

???

Yoda uses the Force to solve Luke's problem in a way Luke never imagined was possible.

This is going to open up Luke's whole world because he can learn from Yoda and not only solve his current but it will broaden his mind to what is possible in the future.

transition: Luke didn't have to derive the Force on his own, and he didn't go on to defeat the Empire himself, he had a whole community.

Open data science is the Force that enables us as scientists to do better science in less time. For me, R is a bit part of this as you'll see.

R and friends empowers us to get our own data out of the swamp.

It empowers us and build off of our confidence and experiences and broaden the scope of scientific challenges that we can tackle, which is relevant whether you are at NOAA or anywhere else.

transition: so my talk will really be framed around these ideas: that the software and the teamwork go hand-in-hand.

## Open data science

**the tooling and people enabling reproducible, transparent, and inclusive practices for data analysis**

I define ODS>..

So I have been thinking about this in terms of open data science tools and practices and teamwork & collaboration, and that they exist in feedback loop. 

So it's not only the tools like the Force or the anlyticcal power of R that lead to better science in less time, it's also the fact that many other people can use or interplay with these tools. 

Learning and using similar software promotes and streamlines teammwork. And also working as a team better equips you to learn open practices data science.

So let's talk about this

An example of this in action is with the Ocean Health Index, which is an assessment framework to quantify the benefits and impacts on oceans at different scales. I’ve worked with the Ocean Health Index since 2013 and there is a lot to say about it that I won't get into today. What’s relevant here is that we combine and model lots of data, we repeat our analyses every year, and we do it as a team. And, because we are a team of marine ecologists, we all came with varying levels of self-taught analytical experience. 

So we found out the hard way that our default approaches for 
data analysis were not reproducible by even ourselves.

 Getting through this involved quite a reckoning, but when we got through it, we knew we had a story to tell.

This fig shows that as we repeated our analyses each year, they were easier to reproduce and it was easier to collaborate, and it took less time each year. We introduced open data science tools and practices iteratively, first focused on repeatability, then collaboration, and now we're focused on training.

And I wanted to highlight that we motivation was because of data prep

Tidy data for easier collaboration! Whether collaborators are current teammates, Future You, or Future Us, organizing and sharing data in a consistent and predictable way means less adjustment, time, and effort for all.

Tidy data for reproducibility and reuse! By using tools that all expect tidy data as 
inputs, you can build and iterate powerful workflows that are easier to understand,  update, and reuse.

Animate: This is what better science in less time looks like for us. Over 4 years we incrementally introduced the tooling like open source coding into our workflow and established team norms. It meant changing the ways that we had always worked during our whole careers, and it was intimidating, because before we started we were like Luke when he just crashed – we couldn’t imagine what was possible and didn’t have confidence that we could do it ourselves. 

But we were able to do this because we had several entryways.

knitr::include_graphics("img/horst_loop_how_we_work_esip_bold.png") 
```

???

animate: The things that benefitted us the most was leadership and trust. A culture of horizontal leadership enabled a team member who knew the tooling to champion it within our team, and for the rest of us to become comfortable with both the benefits and investment it required. We learned from the global R community, and established weekly team meetings where we would co-learn together.

This investment paid off and we had time to focus on new innovation in our science and enable others to build off our work through these new channels. The OHI R package has supported 20 groups around the world that are tailoring our methods to do data-informed ocean management to their own waters, which was unimaginable in the way we worked previously. 

transition: pause

we really worked like a team. It's about kindness, inclusion, and belonging.
