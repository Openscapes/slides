I am actually a squid ecologist, which is why many of you know me as juliesquid. 

That is me on the right, holding a squid that can be nearly as big as I am. 

We caught it and I am releasing it alive back into the ocean with a little electronic tag on it. The tag turns this squid little oceanographer, because it will collect data about it environment as it swims through the ocean. i collected data every second, which means I could actually see the squid breathe, since its breathing and movement are coupled through jet propulsion. 

My whole PhD research group focused on squid. We were interested because squid have huge impact on ecosystems since they eat a lot and grow quickly and they also have huge impact on economies because globally there is such high consumption of calamari. In our lab some focused on ecology like me, others on locomotion, camouflage, or early life development.

This is Luke Skywalker after he crashed his plane in the swamp on Dagobah.

He cannot solve the the challenge in front of him with the skillsets he has.

He is demoralized and alone. And if you imagine him attempting to use whatever pulleys and ropes he might have with him, you know it wouldn't be pretty, it wouldn't be reproducible, and it probably wouldn't get him where he needs to be on time.

Yoda uses the Force to solve Luke's problem in a way Luke never imagined was possible.

This is going to open up Luke's whole world because he can learn from Yoda and not only solve his current but it will broaden his mind to what is possible in the future.

R is the Force that enables us as scientists to do better science in less time.

It empowers us to get our own data out of the swamp.

It empowers us and build off of our confidence and experiences and broaden the scope of scientific challenges that we can tackle, which is relevant whether you are at SCCWRP or anywhere else.

transition: so my talk will really be framed around these ideas: that the software and the teamwork go hand-in-hand.

So I have been thinking about this in terms of open data science tools and practices and teamwork & collaboration, and that they exist in feedback loop. 

So it's not only the tools like the Force or the anlyticcal power of R that lead to better science in less time, it's also the fact that many other people can use or interplay with these tools. 

Learning and using similar software promotes and streamlines teammwork. And also working as a team better equips you to learn open practices data science.

So this is going to be my loose outline for the talk, trying to describe more about this. And I'll do that through 2 programs I've been involved in, which I will introduce briefly first. 

We really felt the power of this feedback loop through OHI

A scientific method, tool, and community for channeling the best available scientific information into marine policy.

It is being used by the United Nations and by 20 groups around the world. 

There is a lot to it but what is relevant here is that we combine lots of data, we repeat our analyses every year, and we do it as a team.

But we are marine scientists, and we were never trained to work responsibly with data. 

So we found out the hard way that our default approaches were not reproducible by even ourselves. 

Getting through this involved quite a reckoning, but when we got through it, we knew we had a story to tell.

It looks like this. 

Shown here as the circles get smaller and moving up the y axis. It also go easier for us to collaborate each year, along the x axis. 

We couldn't overhaul everything all at once, but focused on different pieces incrementally each year. 

Having all of this coding infrastructure in place is what enables those 20 independent groups I mentioned to study ocean health in the places they care about.

An example of this in action is with the Ocean Health Index, where open data science enabled us to do better science in less time and reimagine what is possible. I’ve worked with the Ocean Health Index since 2013 and there is a lot to say about it but what’s relevant here is that we combine lots of data, we repeat our analyses every year, and we do it as a team. And, because we are a team of marine ecologists, we all came with varying levels of self-taught analytical experience. 

Animate: This is what better science in less time looks like for us. Over 4 years we incrementally introduced the tooling like open source coding into our workflow and established team norms. It meant changing the ways that we had always worked during our whole careers, and it was intimidating, because before we started we were like Luke when he just crashed – we couldn’t imagine what was possible and didn’t have confidence that we could do it ourselves. 

But we were able to do this because we had several entryways. 

animate: The things that benefitted us the most was leadership and trust. A culture of horizontal leadership enabled a team member who knew the tooling to champion it within our team, and for the rest of us to become comfortable with both the benefits and investment it required. We learned from the global R community, and established weekly team meetings where we would co-learn together.

This investment paid off and we had time to focus on new innovation in our science and enable others to build off our work through these new channels. The OHI R package has supported 20 groups around the world that are tailoring our methods to do data-informed ocean management to their own waters, which was unimaginable in the way we worked previously.
