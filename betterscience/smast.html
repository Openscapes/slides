This is Luke Skywalker after he crashed his plane in the swamp on Dagobah.

He cannot solve the the challenge in front of him with the skillsets he has.

He is demoralized and alone. And if you imagine him attempting to use whatever pulleys and ropes he might have with him, you know it wouldn't be pretty, it wouldn't be reproducible, and it probably wouldn't get him where he needs to be on time.

transition: but luckily what happens next is that he meets Yoda

Yoda uses the Force to solve Luke's problem in a way Luke never imagined was possible.

This is going to open up Luke's whole world because he can learn from Yoda and not only solve his current but it will broaden his mind to what is possible in the future.

transition: But Luke didn't go on to defeat the Empire himself, he had a whole community.

R is the Force that enables us as scientists to do better science in less time.

It empowers us to get our own data out of the swamp.

It empowers us and build off of our confidence and experiences and broaden the scope of scientific challenges that we can tackle, which is relevant whether you are at SCCWRP or anywhere else.

transition: so my talk will really be framed around these ideas: that the software and the teamwork go hand-in-hand.

To ease us back to this galaxy, the way I have been thinking about it, open data science tools and practices and teamwork &amp; collaboration exist in this feedback loop. 

Learning and using similar software promotes and streamlines teammwork. And also working as a team better equips you to learn open practices data science.

But as env scientists, we're never taught data science/open practices, and we're not taught to work as a team, even when we are physically sitting with other scientists similar to us in our research groups research group

So despite this being a really powerful feedback loop, many scientists are outside of it, without clear entry points. 

To set the stage a bit, let me briefly introduce 2 project I'll be talking about today:

A scientific method, tool, and community for channeling the best available scientific information into marine policy.

It is being used by the United Nations and by 20 groups around the world. 

There is a lot to it but what is relevant here is that we combine lots of data, we repeat our analyses every year, and we do it as a team.

But we are marine scientists, and we were never trained to work responsibly with data. 

So we found out the hard way that our default approaches were not reproducible by even ourselves. 

Getting through this involved quite a reckoning, but when we got through it, we knew we had a story to tell.

It looks like this. 

Shown here as the circles get smaller and moving up the y axis. It also go easier for us to collaborate each year, along the x axis. 

We couldn't overhaul everything all at once, but focused on different pieces incrementally each year. 

Having all of this coding infrastructure in place is what enables those 20 independent groups I mentioned to study ocean health in the places they care about.

Teamwork started with trust and willingness. 

Not everyone codes. But everyone values

This took time. There was more jazz than buy-in fromt the rest of us for a long while: for example I set up my GitHub account to go directly to my spam folder.

But with time, patience, and incusion, we all got on board.

We call these conversations Seaside Chats, or Bayside, Bluffside or Fishbowl chats. They are specific times and places to talk about reproducible research, discuss coding issues, and learn about cool new packages relevant for research. 

This something that our OHI team has been doing for years now in addition to our weekly science lab meetings. This is a dedicated space to discuss and develop shared systems for the lab start weaving open data science into their every day work

We have also coopted the term hackathon, which is when our OHI team we will all drop our own projects and come together for a day or an afternoon to do something that will benefit the whole group, but is no one person's responsibility,like upgrading our filepath strategies with the "here" package. 

Some labs have also done hackathons too, and gotten metadata organized and developed onboarding procedures for the lab, so that new teammembers can get on board with the lab's workflow as soon as possible.

We're missing this feedback loop. It's hard to learn these tools if you feel like it's all on you and you're alone, and it's hard to engage with your team if there's no catalyst. 

Luke never would have imagined to expect that the Force existed unless he had seen it and learned it. He had heard about it and thought it was offlimits or some hokey thing.

Individuals aren't aware of what's possible, and research groups aren't thinking like teams. We talk about science but not data.

And it's been exciting to not only see changes within labs, but across them, and new UW alliances.

Teams to me mean rings of people you respect, innovate with, and can rely upon. It does not have to be limited to a certain deliverable, location, discipline or anything else really. 

This trust really centers on respect for each other and also kindness.

But on an individual level, we all have had to get comfortable with sharing things before they are perfect and being vulnerable to critique, which gets easier when you can assume the best intentions from anyone's feedback. 

But this has resulted in a really positive team culture, where we are comfortable with trying new things &amp; learning from failure, and we are comfortable asking for help.

Halley has a big science following already and now tweets also about open data science, so this is a great example of the influence these champions are already having.
