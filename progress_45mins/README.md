These slides are for a 45-minute seminar as a progress updated 2 months into my Mozilla Fellowship. I give a brief, incomplete introduction to the inspiring work that Mozilla does, and I introduce the Openscapes program. The audience are environmental scientists at the weekly "rountable" seminar at the National Center for Ecological Analysis & Synthesis (NCEAS).
