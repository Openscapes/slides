**The tooling and people enabling reproducible, transparent, and inclusive practices for data-intensive science**

::: {.notes}
A beautiful feedback loop: Using similar tooling promotes and streamlines teamwork. And teamwork better equips you to learn new tooling. With this shared mindset, the idea of team becomes ever-broadening, along with your abilities to adapt to an evolving softwarescape.

**"Openscapes has created a new way of thinking about merging empathy and science. That's an invaluable gift to me."** - Dr. Halley Froehlich, UCSB

**"Openscapes gave me a perspective of how all these open data science tools work together and can be used to bring natural resource conservation and ecology into the 21st century."** - Researcher, NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service

![](images/openscapes_theory_of_change.png){fig-align="center"} 

::: {.notes}
Reframe data-intensive research as collaborative effort not an individual burden. students participate in research faster • grant money goes further • co-creating norms promoting diversity, equity & inclusion • new collaborations • on/offboarding • leadership

Biggest lesson: power of research teams & data science to normalize open science
:::

## [Openscapes approach]{style="color:#45818e"}

Researcher-centered, focused on teams. Practice and feel safe working openly with yourself and your team; then ease into more.

Create space & place to explore & learn. Cohort Calls, Seaside Chats, Co-Working; GitHub, R, Python, Google Drive, Slack; Efficiency Tips & Inclusion Tips.

Cultivate relationships & real connections. Welcoming folks with diverse backgrounds; meeting where they are; skills to empower immediate work; kinder science.

Learning & iterating, openly. Not a checklist but a continual practice. Messy.

# If you had to pick one single thing that you're taking away from the Cloud Hackathon, what would it be, and why?

![](images/Openscapes_ESIP10min_2022_01_1865.png)

# I have a much better understanding of how cloud computing works and could be used in the future.

It's worth investing the extra time required to become familiar with cloud computing and the newer python libraries to access and manipulate satellite data. The few hundred lines of code I wrote this week will replace several thousand lines of old code using just numpy! It's also a heck of a lot easier to read and use.

I need to work at this consistently, not haphazardly, to make real progress in my skill set.

All of the positive energy and excitement around collaboration, cloud computing, and developing shared resources - it's exciting to see this work gaining broader momentum and adoption. Code wise - Amy's function for reading specific variables from an hdf5 file on the cloud into xarray.

Collaborators - there is a lot of knowledge within this group and it is nice to know that there are people working on similar problems and you have someone to talk to when creating code.

There are many options for accessing data, and expertise/experience is needed to figure these out. But- it's possible and I now have many tools to do so. I feel confident I can figure it out with the tools I learned this week.

Using CMR and S3 FS to programmatically access data files on S3

# What were some of the pain points you've encountered during the hackathon, or what are some concepts that you would want to revisit?

![](images/Openscapes_ESIP10min_2022_01_1866.png)

# Working with large datasets, working with GIT through Jupyter HUB.

There were a number of different workflows to different datasets, as outlined in the tutorials. A general flow diagram or cheatsheet of what workflow goes best with which dataset and why would be useful.

The tutorials were fantastic, but I struggled to figure out when to use the various methods we learned in the tutorials.

API's were super cool, I'm not aware about all the API's used in the hackathon.

Cloud computing and git can be challenging to use if you don't use them everyday. Without education and hackathons like this one, many scientists will have trouble transitioning to cloud computing unless they have the financial resources to support programmers.

I was insufficiently prepared with python skills....I think the cloud searching was over emphasized, because most of us came knowing which data sets we intend to use (e.g., by searching the PO.DAAC catalog for cloud enabled data sets).

I didn't know what was meant by "On-Premise" data. I thought I knew. I thought it meant data on my local computer. The next day I needed to work with 'On-premise' data and then I figured out how I hadn't really understood the whole 'cloud' computing framework. In fact I am still fuzzy but am now more aware of how fuzzy my understanding is.

The spin-up was longer than expected to learn how to access the data. Help was essential to understanding why I couldn't access some data using scripts written for another dataset. Eventually will need more help with accessing troublesome datasets in the future.

I wish we had started at this very low level and had more emphasis on the basics (and less on what to do with the data after obtaining it): (1) Find the concept ID/short name for a given data set (could be via internet browsing) (2) Make a list of addresses to access the files in S3 (3) Access the files (ingest into python, perhaps with xarray)"

lack of cloud knowledge and experience to better understand the codes, and discern which codes/services are better or preferable than others.
