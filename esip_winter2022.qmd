::: {.notes}
A beautiful feedback loop: Using similar tooling promotes and streamlines teamwork. And teamwork better equips you to learn new tooling. With this shared mindset, the idea of team becomes ever-broadening, along with your abilities to adapt to an evolving softwarescape.

**"This isn't just about coding & GitHub, it's about changing the way we do science"** - Dr. Malin Pinsky, Rutgers*

<br>

**"Openscapes has created a new way of thinking about merging empathy and science. That's an invaluable gift to me."** - Dr. Halley Froehlich, UCSB

<br>

**"Openscapes gave me a perspective of how all these open data science tools work together and can be used to bring natural resource conservation and ecology into the 21st century."** - Researcher, NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service 


## [Working more openly and inclusively]{style="color:#45818e"}


![](images/openscapes_theory_of_change.png){fig-align="center"} 

::: {.notes}
Reframe data-intensive research as collaborative effort not an individual burden. students participate in research faster • grant money goes further • co-creating norms promoting diversity, equity & inclusion • new collaborations • on/offboarding • leadership

Biggest lesson: power of research teams & data science to normalize open science

## [Openscapes approach]{style="color:#45818e"}
[[*https://openscapes.org/approach*]{style="color:#45818E"}](https://openscapes.org/approach)

[**Researcher-centered, focused on teams.** Practice and feel safe working openly w/ yourself & your team; then ease into more.]{style="color:#5E696C"}

[**Create space & place to explore & learn.** Cohort Calls, Seaside Chats, Co-Working; GitHub, R, Python, Quarto, Google Drive, Slack; Efficiency Tips & Inclusion Tips.]{style="color:#5E696C"}

[**Cultivate relationships & real connections.** Welcoming folks with diverse backgrounds; meeting where they are; skills to empower immediate work; kinder science.]{style="color:#5E696C"}

[**Learning & iterating, openly.** Not a checklist but a continual practice. Imperfect and messy.]{style="color:#5E696C"}


## [NASA Earthdata & Openscapes]{style="color:#45818e"}


**Supporting Earthdata research teams' migration to the cloud**

<br>

[**The overarching vision**]{style="color:#666666"} [is to support scientific researcher teams using NASA EOSDIS data as they migrate their workflows to the cloud. We are doing this working with NASA Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs) over three years by:]{style="color:#666666"}

- [**Develop a cross-DAAC Mentor community**]{style="color:#666666"}
- [**Empower science teams through the Champions program**]{style="color:#666666"}
- [**Scale the Champions program with DAAC Mentors**]{style="color:#666666"}

![](images/nasa-openscapes.png){width=10% fig-align="right"} 

::: {.notes}
- Develop a cross-DAAC Mentor community [of collaborative cloud data instructors, that co-create, curate, and use shared resources ("make once, use often")
- Empower science teams through the Champions programto migrate their download- intensive data analysis workflows to the cloud and open, kinder science
- Scale the Openscapes Champions program with DAAC Mentorsto support more teams transforming their workflows towards open, kinder science and the cloud

**"It was a really great week. The tutorials were AMAZING. Everyone did a great job, and everyone was very nice. I really appreciated welcoming environment. I don't have a strong python background. But I was supported in learning all around"** - Hackathon Participant

<br>

**It's worth investing the extra time required to become familiar with cloud computing and the newer python libraries to access and manipulate satellite data. The few hundred lines of code I wrote this week will replace several thousand lines of old code using just numpy! It's also a heck of a lot easier to read and use.** - Hackathon Participant

The tutorials were fantastic, but I struggled to figure out **when** to use the various methods we learned in the tutorials.
