# Today's goals

Showcase good practices for beginning and seasoned R users alike.  

Take some time to reflect on how we code or aspire to code: code for ourselves, our future selves, and others.

POP

P: 
- create more champions
- create habits for talking about data (normalize)
(- value and talk about open data science)

O:
- Impact has been the mindset shifts in individuals, culture shifts in labs, and increase in skills and practice 
- More measurable:
  - seaside chats
  - lab github organizations
  - coding clubs
  - lab
- slide of all the little things

P:
remote calls like Moz Open Leaders



Biggest things I've learned
- don't think of lab like a team
- 


What Champions are doing

(Adrian)
- talking about open data science in faculty meetings saying we’re doing our students a disservice
- asking to fund lectuere positions
- enabling their labs to have seaside chats
- coming up with onboaring plans
- supporting students with tidytuesday

(Malin)
Started taking lab notes in google docs, openscapes style!
Michelle trying to teach a course at Rutgers
It’s helping! Something I’ve worried about a lot and feeling better about it :)
RLadies Highland Park! First NJ RLadies!!!


Working on a paper with the Champions


Things to do better

- diversity
- data
- length? (5 months / semesters & quarters)

“Sexual misconduct happens everywhere,” Ross said. “But DataCamp was dealing with a community with abnormally high standards and support for each other.”

- i'm marine ecol, which means enviro sci, best community
- software, best, like you
- open, moz best
- bridging all. OHI. And now Openscapes:: because env. sci: luke, yoda. *more powerful than we ever imagined. opened our minds*

but first about OHI, how we work
but first describe team, because we seem bigger than we are, and we are more skilled than we were 6 years ago. actually diff responsibilities. more like a lab than a software company 
  - think: how is this like your group, diff 
  
our team circa episode IV. 
- yoda: bb
- us: leia, luke, han. 
- ben: r2d2. 
  
How R helped us get there. Not just the actual tools, but also enabled this mindset.   
- went form forwareded excel sheets to Rmd data prep. share all. 
- 


So waht do we teach in openscapes

- seaside chags
-hackathons
-study groups
-cocs. deliberateness. planning together. google docs. 
- also rmd, tidyverse. rOpensci

Take homes from these 3 communities: 
- work like a team, and a movement

-ropensci good for bridging env sci with software

-think of your lab like a team, 


Also incorp:
- reduce friction
- squid? 


Ask Allison: does she like it? illustrations vs. screenshots

pic of me on boat

???

I am a marine ecologist, and open data science has been game-changing for my science and my life. I'm going to tell you a bit about my story and my path and how we can all change science

pic of me with squid, with tags

???

For my PhD I was interested in how climate change was affecting behavior and ecology of squid...food sources, etc. 
I'd go out on boats, tag, etc. And there, in my hand, I'm hold data. Amazing. where it went, habitat conditions, etc. 
But I pretty quickly lost that enthusiasm: the data were big data to me: too big for excel. The only tool I knew. it was the worst. I like to talk about it in terms of Star Wars analogies.

demoralizing, lonely

ODS, amazing

I feel so lucky to have stumbled upon this community and to be a part of it. 
We found this on our own, had to seek it out. No one told us. Not a thing that is in the culture of science. 
Turned the tide. It is because of people like Hadley and Karthik and Jenny who were real people, nice people, who welcomed us in

ODS headlines

We protect our own. Datacamp. This matters. Thank you for everyone involved directly and in supporting and enabling roles. We are all here to learn from, with, and for each other.

Environmental scientists are doing really critical and amazing work. Solving these problems.

R4DS minus hadley

???

They are really comfortable in the science and in the communication parts. They are literally coming back from fieldwork aroudn the world to testify before congress etc. 
But there is a huge missing piece: 

---
R4DS


???

But we all know how powerful data science is. 
But they are unsupported in the data science. They are never taught computing, never taught data science. We could be so much more effective if we knew that #rstats exists and that it is a welcoming place


---
The kind, welcoming nature of rstats

???

What if science felt like #rstats?
