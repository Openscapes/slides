I've been thinking a lot about this feedback loop and am excited to be able to talk it through with you a bit more. 

Learning and using similar software promotes and streamlines teammwork. And also working as a team better equips you to learn open practices data science.

The Ocean Health Index is a scientific endeavor to quantify impacts and benefits of oceans around the world using the best publically available data. 

It is being used by the United Nations and by 20 groups around the world. 

There is a lot to it but what is relevant here is that we combine lots of data, we repeat our analyses every year, and we do it as a team.

This is Luke Skywalker after he crashed his plane on Dagobah. He is there staring at a problem that he can’t solve with the skillsets he has, and it is demoralizing. 

This plane can represent a lot of things for data analysis. 
As an individual, it can be data that is too big to be opened in Excel. 
It can be your self-taught code that you are too ashamed of embarrassed to share
And as a team, it can be not being able to run code sent by a colleague. 
It can be the time spent organizing the files your students send you through a mosaic of Google Drive and GitHub links, email attachments, and thumb drives. 

For environmental scientists, there are ways big and small that can leave you feeling like Luke here. 

If you imagine what it would be like for Luke if he had used whatever ropes or pulleys he had on hand, it probably wouldn’t have been pretty, reproducible, or gotten him where he needs to be on time.

transition: but luckily what happens next is that he meets Yoda

---
class: top, center
```{r yoda, out.width = '88%'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/horst-starwars-yoda.png") 
```

.footnote[

]

???

But Yoda comes along and can solve Luke's problem in a way Luke never imagined. He uses the Force. And the Force is a powerful skillset and mindset because Luke can see this and learn from Yoda, and he can go on then to not only solve his current but it will broaden his mind to what is possible in the future.

Open data science is the Force that helps us do better science in less time. It can be:
As an individual: 
code in an open source language like R, having your own work be more automated and reproducible 
And as a team: 

coding and coordinating collaboratively with tools like GitHub
being empowered by open practices and having it be part of the whole research process
These types of practices not only save time and are more reproducible, but it’s a whole mindset of what is possible as you reduce friction in the day-to-day analyses and become comfortable with the power of these tools. 

So the Force is a powerful thing, but importantly, it is not something that exists on its own.

Transition: But Luke didn't go on to defeat the Empire himself, he had a whole community.

And this community is powerful because of the diversity of backgrounds and expertise, and although not everyone is a Jedi, everyone contributes in really critical ways.

So in science this can be
Teaching scientists how to code through university courses and trainings like the Carpentries
Championing open science by mentioning it in science talks, publications faculty meetings, 
Funding opportunities for scientists to participate in open science
Building software to meet scientists where they are

R is the Force that enables us as scientists to do better science in less time. 

It empowers us to get our own data out of the swamp. 

It empowers us and build off of our confidence and experiences and broaden the scope of scientific challenges that we can tackle, which for environmental scientists, includes food security, disease transmission, and climate change. 

For me, I didn't fully feel the power of R until I finished graduate school and joined a research group where I am today, where we learned to work with data as a team. 

transition: So I'll talk today about

OHI models tourism, clean waters, and biodiversity, among others, synthesizing nearly 100 data sets into quantitative scores that can be tracked through time and inform policy. 
We lead assessments at the global scale, like the bottom left, which we've done each  year since 2012 and being formally considered for UN SDG 14; also in the US Northeast, tracking change for the last 10 years.

???

It looks like this. 

Shown here as the circles get smaller and moving up the y axis. It also go easier for us to collaborate each year, along the x axis. 

This let us focus on making improvements either on the data science side or the science side

We couldn't overhaul everything all at once, but focused on different pieces incrementally each year. 

We started off focused on R and RStudio, and then on using Git and GitHub, then on tidy data and then documentation and Rmd. And ever since we've focused on leading a training program to teach students how to maintain it. 

Having all of this coding infrastructure in place is what enables those 20 independent groups I mentioned to study ocean health in the places they care about.

This graphic really changed they way we work and think.

We learned how to talk about data, how to think together about it. 

Our story started with us not working like a team. Having one person who knew how to code. Very inefficient, very brittle. 

See this in OHI+ as well: hire one person to code, no decision making, no creativity, no domain knowledge. 

What you really want in a team.

We're missing this feedback loop. It's hard to learn these tools if you feel like it's all on you and you're alone, and it's hard to engage with your team if there's no catalyst. Luke never would have imagined to expect that the Force existed unless he had seen it and learned it. He had heard about it and thought it was offlimits or some hokey thing.

Individuals aren't aware of what's possible, and research groups aren't thinking like teams. We talk about science but not data.

### We welcome scientists to open data science by mentoring research teams.

**Engage**: build awareness and excitement with empathy, art, and storytelling  
**Empower**: connect with existing open software and communities  
**Amplify**: champion broadly to increase visibility, value, and practice

That's what we were did in this first cohort that I mentioned. Really focused on the teamwork side, but immediately around open data science and iteratively, make this a spiral 

And it's been exciting to not only see changes within labs, but across them, and new UW alliances. 

transition: really focused on enabling others

And there's been amazing momentum, both from mentees and for the program, which is awesome. We plan to have further cohorts,  available for bookings and sponsorships.

Teams to me mean rings of people you respect, innovate with, and can rely upon. It does not have to be limited to a certain deliverable, location, discipline or anything else really. 

Teamwork is critical in science because no one it can do it all. And for the sake for innovation as well as for emotional well-being we need to shed the expectation that we should be able to. Instead, we need to value teamwork. 
We as an OHI team have spent years building up trust with each other, and that makes us be able to do our best work. 

This trust really centers on respect for each other and also kindness.

But on an individual level, we all have had to get comfortable with sharing things before they are perfect and being vulnerable to critique, which gets easier when you can assume the best intentions from anyone's feedback. 

But this has resulted in a really positive team culture, where we are comfortable with trying new things & learning from failure, and we are comfortable asking for help.

One of the cool things she did to give back to the community is she created this website for her classes and posted all course materials and homeworks online. 

This is now a resource for Allison's students but also for anyone else wanting to learn on their own, or teach their own course.

I mentioned that Michelle is going to teach a new open data science course; she is going to use Allison's lessons.

transition: Those are just some stories of the teamwork, leadership, and community involvement that the Openscapes champions have been engaged in.
